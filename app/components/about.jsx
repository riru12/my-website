                    Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Brill RiÃ±a and I'm currently finishing my BS Computer Science degree in the University of the Philippines Diliman. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I have experience working with Python, C, JavaScript, React, Next, HTML, and Git. I am always eager to learn new things and looking to expand my skill set and hone it further. You can check out my stuff in my <span className="text-[#a8bae8]"><a href="https://github.com/riru12" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a></span>!
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I am also a freelance digital artist! I like to paint and draw in my leisure time. I am very knowledgeable in graphic design as well. If you're interested in seeing some of my artwork, check out <span className="text-[#a8bae8]"><a href="https://twitter.com/artofriru" target="_blank">my twitter</a></span>!
